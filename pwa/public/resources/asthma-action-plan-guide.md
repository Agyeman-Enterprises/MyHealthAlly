## Your Medicines Explained

### Controller Medicines (Take Every Day)

These PREVENT symptoms — take even when feeling well!

| Type | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)** | Reduces airway swelling |
| **Long-acting bronchodilators (LABA)** | Keeps airways open 12-24 hours |
| **Combination inhalers** | ICS + LABA together |
| **Leukotriene modifiers** | Blocks inflammation chemicals |
| **Biologics** | For severe asthma, reduces specific inflammation |

### Quick-Relief Medicines (Use When Needed)

These TREAT symptoms when they happen:

| Type | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Short-acting bronchodilators (SABA)** | Opens airways fast (5-15 minutes) |
| **Examples:** Albuterol, Levalbuterol | Lasts 4-6 hours |

### Using Your Inhaler Correctly

**With a Spacer (recommended):**
1. Shake inhaler well
2. Attach to spacer
3. Breathe out completely
4. Put spacer mouthpiece in mouth
