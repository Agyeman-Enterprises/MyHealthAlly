## Why Lab Tests Matter

Lab tests help your healthcare provider:
- **Diagnose conditions** - Find out what's causing symptoms
- **Monitor health** - Track how well treatments are working
- **Prevent problems** - Catch issues early before symptoms appear
- **Screen for disease** - Find conditions before they cause problems

Understanding your lab results helps you be an active partner in your healthcare.

## Common Lab Tests Explained

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)

Measures different types of cells in your blood:

| Test | What It Measures | Normal Range (varies by lab) |
|------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **White Blood Cells (WBC)** | Infection fighters | 4,500-11,000 cells/μL |
| **Red Blood Cells (RBC)** | Oxygen carriers | 4.5-5.5 million cells/μL (men), 4.0-5.0 (women) |
| **Hemoglobin (Hgb)** | Protein in red blood cells | 13.5-17.5 g/dL (men), 12.0-15.5 (women) |
| **Hematocrit (Hct)** | Percentage of red blood cells | 38.8-50% (men), 34.9-44.5% (women) |
| **Platelets** | Help with clotting | 150,000-450,000 cells/μL |

**What abnormal results might mean:**
- **High WBC:** Infection, inflammation, stress
- **Low WBC:** Some medications, immune system problems
- **Low Hgb/Hct:** Anemia (low iron, blood loss, other causes)
- **High Hgb/Hct:** Dehydration, lung disease, other conditions

### Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)

Measures chemicals in your blood:

| Test | What It Measures | Normal Range |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Glucose** | Blood sugar | 70-100 mg/dL (fasting) |
| **Sodium** | Electrolyte balance | 136-145 mEq/L |
| **Potassium** | Heart and muscle function | 3.5-5.0 mEq/L |
| **Creatinine** | Kidney function | 0.6-1.2 mg/dL (men), 0.5-1.1 (women) |
| **BUN** | Kidney function | 7-20 mg/dL |

**What abnormal results might mean:**
- **High glucose:** Diabetes, prediabetes
- **High/low sodium:** Dehydration, kidney problems, medications
- **High/low potassium:** Kidney problems, medications, heart issues
- **High creatinine/BUN:** Kidney problems

### Lipid Panel (Cholesterol)

Measures fats in your blood:

| Test | What It Measures | Target (varies by risk) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Total Cholesterol** | All cholesterol | <200 mg/dL (ideal) |
| **LDL ("Bad")** | Can build up in arteries | <100 mg/dL (optimal) |
| **HDL ("Good")** | Protects heart | >40 mg/dL (men), >50 (women) |
| **Triglycerides** | Fat in blood | <150 mg/dL (normal) |

**What abnormal results might mean:**
- **High LDL:** Increased heart disease risk
- **Low HDL:** Increased heart disease risk
- **High triglycerides:** Increased heart disease risk, metabolic syndrome

### Liver Function Tests (LFTs)

Measures liver health:

| Test | What It Measures | Normal Range |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **ALT** | Liver enzyme | 7-56 U/L (men), 5-36 (women) |
| **AST** | Liver enzyme | 10-40 U/L |
| **Bilirubin** | Waste product | 0.1-1.2 mg/dL |
| **Albumin** | Protein made by liver | 3.5-5.0 g/dL |

**What abnormal results might mean:**
- **High ALT/AST:** Liver damage, medications, alcohol
- **High bilirubin:** Liver problems, bile duct issues
- **Low albumin:** Liver disease, malnutrition, kidney problems

---

### Thyroid Function Tests

Measures thyroid hormone levels:

| Test | What It Measures | Normal Range |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **TSH** | Thyroid stimulating hormone | 0.4-4.0 mIU/L |
| **T4 (Free)** | Active thyroid hormone | 0.8-1.8 ng/dL |
| **T3 (Free)** | Active thyroid hormone | 2.3-4.2 pg/mL |

**What abnormal results might mean:**
- **High TSH, Low T4:** Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
- **Low TSH, High T4:** Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)

## Understanding Your Results

### Normal vs. Abnormal

**Important:** Normal ranges vary by:
- **Lab** - Different labs use different methods
- **Age** - Normal changes with age
- **Sex** - Men and women have different ranges
- **Health conditions** - Some conditions change what's "normal"

### What the Numbers Mean

- **Within normal range:** Usually means healthy, but not always
- **Slightly outside range:** May be normal for you, or early warning
- **Far outside range:** Usually needs attention

**Always discuss results with your healthcare provider.**

## Common Patterns

### Anemia (Low Red Blood Cells)

**Signs:**
- Low hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count
- Fatigue, weakness, pale skin

**Common causes:**
- Iron deficiency
- Blood loss
- Chronic disease
- Vitamin deficiencies

### Diabetes/Prediabetes

**Signs:**
- High glucose (fasting >100, or A1C >5.7%)

**What it means:**
- **Prediabetes:** Higher risk, can often be reversed
- **Diabetes:** Needs management

### Kidney Problems

**Signs:**
- High creatinine or BUN
- May have no symptoms early on

**What it means:**
- Kidneys may not be filtering well
- Needs monitoring and possibly treatment

### High Cholesterol

**Signs:**
- High LDL, low HDL, or high triglycerides

**What it means:**
- Increased risk of heart disease
- Often managed with lifestyle and medications

## When to Be Concerned

### Call Your Provider Immediately If:

- Results show critical values (lab will usually call you)
- You have symptoms that match abnormal results
- Results are very far outside normal range

### Schedule Follow-Up If:

- Results are slightly outside normal
- You have questions about results
- Your provider recommends monitoring

### Don't Worry If:

- One value is slightly off
- Your provider says it's normal for you
- Results are being monitored over time

## Getting the Most from Your Lab Results

### Before Your Test

- **Follow instructions** - Fasting if required
- **List medications** - Tell your provider about all medications
- **Ask questions** - Why is this test being done?

### After Your Results

- **Review with provider** - Don't just read numbers
- **Ask questions** - What do these numbers mean for me?
- **Track over time** - Trends matter more than single values
- **Understand goals** - What are we trying to achieve?

### Keep Records

- Save copies of all lab results
- Track trends over time
- Bring to appointments
- Share with new providers

## Key Takeaways

1. **Normal ranges vary** - Don't compare to others
2. **One abnormal value** - May not be a problem
3. **Trends matter** - Changes over time are important
4. **Context matters** - Your overall health affects results
5. **Ask questions** - Your provider can explain what's normal for you
6. **Follow up** - If results are abnormal, follow your provider's recommendations
