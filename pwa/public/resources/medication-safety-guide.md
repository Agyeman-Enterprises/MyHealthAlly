## Taking Medications Correctly

### Follow Your Prescription Exactly

- **Take the right dose** - Don't skip doses or take extra

### With or Without Food?

Some medications work better with food, others on an empty stomach:

- **Check the label** or ask your pharmacist if unsure

### Timing Matters

- **Once daily:** Take at the same time each day
- **Twice daily:** Usually morning and evening, 12 hours apart
- **With meals:** Take with breakfast, lunch, or dinner
- **Before bed:** Some medications cause drowsiness
