# Understanding Your COPD
## A Patient Guide Based on GOLD 2025 Guidelines

## What is COPD?

**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** is a lung condition that makes it harder to breathe. It includes:
- **Chronic bronchitis** — inflammation and mucus in airways
- **Emphysema** — damage to air sacs in lungs

COPD develops slowly over years and is treatable. With proper management, you can live an active life.

## Understanding Your Numbers

### Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)

| Your Target | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **88-92%** | ✅ This is YOUR goal range |
| **>92%** | ⚠️ Too high can be harmful for COPD |
| **<85%** | 🚨 Too low — contact your care team |

**Important:** Unlike most people who target 95%+, COPD patients do best at 88-92%. Higher oxygen levels can actually cause problems by increasing CO2 in your blood.

### Spirometry Results

Your breathing test shows how well your lungs work:

| GOLD Stage | FEV1 | What It Means |
|------------|------|---------------|
| **1 - Mild** | ≥80% | Lungs work fairly well |
| **2 - Moderate** | 50-79% | Some limitation |
| **3 - Severe** | 30-49% | Significant limitation |
| **4 - Very Severe** | <30% | Severe limitation |

FEV1 = How much air you can blow out in 1 second

## Your Medications

### Controller Medications (Take Daily)

These prevent symptoms — **don't skip them even when feeling well**

| Type | Examples | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **LABA** | Salmeterol, Formoterol | Long-acting bronchodilator |
| **LAMA** | Tiotropium, Umeclidinium | Opens airways 24 hours |
| **ICS** | Fluticasone, Budesonide | Reduces inflammation |
| **Triple Therapy** | Trelegy, Breztri | LABA + LAMA + ICS combined |

### Rescue Medications (Use When Needed)

| Type | Examples | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **SABA** | Albuterol, Levalbuterol | Sudden shortness of breath |

**Tip:** If using rescue inhaler more than 2-3 times per week, tell your care team — your controller may need adjustment.

## Oxygen Therapy

If you use supplemental oxygen:

### Key Rules

1. **Use as prescribed** — don't adjust flow rate without asking
2. **Target 88-92% SpO2** — higher is NOT better for COPD
3. **Never smoke near oxygen** — fire hazard
4. **Travel planning** — notify airline 48+ hours ahead
5. **Exercise** — you may need higher flow during activity

### Common Flow Rates

| Activity | Typical Flow |
|----------|--------------|
| Rest | 1-2 L/min |
| Walking/Activity | 2-4 L/min |
| Sleep | May differ — ask your provider |

## Preventing Flare-Ups (Exacerbations)

### Top Prevention Strategies

1. **Get vaccinated**
   - Flu shot yearly
   - Pneumonia vaccines
   - COVID-19 vaccines
   - RSV vaccine (if eligible)

2. **Avoid triggers**
   - Cigarette/vape smoke
   - Air pollution (check AQI)
   - Strong fumes and chemicals
   - Dust and allergens
   - Cold dry air (wear a scarf over mouth)

3. **Stay active**
   - Pulmonary rehabilitation
   - Daily walking (as tolerated)
   - Breathing exercises

4. **Maintain nutrition**
   - Eat smaller, frequent meals
   - Stay hydrated
   - Limit salt (reduces fluid retention)

5. **Manage stress**
   - Anxiety worsens breathlessness
   - Practice relaxation techniques
   - Join a support group

## Breathing Techniques

### Pursed-Lip Breathing

Use when short of breath:

1. Relax your shoulders
2. Breathe IN through your nose for 2 counts
3. Pucker lips like blowing out a candle
4. Breathe OUT slowly for 4 counts
5. Repeat until breathing eases

### Diaphragmatic Breathing

1. Sit comfortably or lie down
2. Place one hand on chest, one on belly
3. Breathe in — belly should rise, chest stays still
4. Breathe out slowly — belly falls
5. Practice 5-10 minutes daily
