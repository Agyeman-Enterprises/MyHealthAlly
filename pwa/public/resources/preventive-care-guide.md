## Why Preventive Care Matters

Preventive care helps you:
- **Catch problems early** - When they're easier to treat
- **Prevent serious illness** - Stop problems before they start
- **Stay healthy longer** - Maintain your quality of life
- **Save money** - Prevention costs less than treatment

Think of preventive care as maintenance for your body, like regular oil changes for your car.
