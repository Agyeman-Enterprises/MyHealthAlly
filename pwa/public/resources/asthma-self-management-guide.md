# Living Well with Asthma
## Your Complete Self-Management Guide

## What is Asthma?

Asthma is a chronic condition where your airways:
- **Swell** (inflammation)
- **Narrow** (bronchoconstriction)
- **Produce extra mucus**

This makes it harder to breathe and causes symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

**Good news:** With proper management, most people with asthma can:
- ✅ Live active, normal lives
- ✅ Exercise and play sports
- ✅ Sleep through the night
- ✅ Avoid emergency visits
- ✅ Have minimal or no symptoms

## Signs of Well-Controlled Asthma

Your asthma is well controlled when you:

| ✅ Good Control | ❌ Poor Control |
|----------------|-----------------|
| No daytime symptoms | Symptoms 2+ days/week |
| No nighttime waking | Waking at night |
| No activity limitations | Can't do normal activities |
| Quick-relief use ≤2 days/week | Using rescue inhaler daily |
| Peak flow 80-100% of best | Peak flow dropping |
| No flare-ups | Frequent flare-ups |

**Goal:** Everyone with asthma can achieve good control!

## Understanding Your Triggers

Triggers are things that set off your asthma. Everyone's triggers are different.

### Common Triggers

**Allergens:**

- ❄️ Cold air
- 😰 Strong emotions (stress, laughing hard)
- 💊 Certain medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, beta-blockers)

### Managing Your Triggers

**At Home:**

## Your Medicines

### Controller Medicines — Take Every Day

These prevent symptoms by reducing inflammation. **Take even when feeling well!**

| Medicine Type | How It Works | Take When |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)** | Reduces swelling in airways | Daily, 1-2x/day |
| **Long-Acting Beta Agonists (LABA)** | Keeps airways open 12 hours | Usually with ICS |
| **Leukotriene Modifiers** | Blocks inflammation pathway | Daily, usually at night |
| **Combination Inhalers** | ICS + LABA in one device | Daily, 1-2x/day |

**Examples:** Flovent, Advair, Symbicort, Breo, Singulair

### Quick-Relief Medicines — Use When Needed

These treat symptoms fast when they happen.

| Medicine Type | How It Works | Use When |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Short-Acting Beta Agonists (SABA)** | Opens airways in 5-15 minutes | Symptoms or before exercise |

**Examples:** Albuterol (ProAir, Ventolin), Levalbuterol (Xopenex)

**Warning Sign:** If using SABA more than 2 days per week, your asthma isn't well controlled. Talk to your doctor!

### Inhaler Technique Matters!

Up to 90% of people use their inhaler incorrectly. Poor technique = medicine doesn't work.

**Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) with Spacer:**
1. Remove cap, shake well
2. Attach spacer
3. Breathe OUT completely
4. Put mouthpiece in mouth
5. Start breathing IN slowly
6. Press canister while breathing in
7. Continue slow, deep breath
8. Hold breath 10 seconds
9. Wait 1 minute between puffs
10. Rinse mouth after steroid inhalers

**Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI):**
1. Load dose as directed
2. Breathe OUT away from device
3. Put mouthpiece in mouth
4. Breathe IN fast and deep
5. Hold breath 10 seconds
6. Rinse mouth after steroids

## Peak Flow Monitoring

A peak flow meter measures how well air moves out of your lungs.

### Why Use It?
- Detects problems BEFORE you feel symptoms
- Shows if medicine is working
- Helps identify your triggers
- Guides treatment decisions

### Your Peak Flow Zones

| Zone | % of Personal Best | Meaning |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 🟢 **GREEN** | 80-100% | All clear — keep doing what you're doing |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | 50-80% | Caution — airways narrowing, take action |
| 🔴 **RED** | Below 50% | Medical alert — get help now |

### When to Check Peak Flow
- Every morning before medicines (most useful)
- When having symptoms
- Before and after exercise
- When exposed to triggers
- During illness

---

## Exercise and Asthma

**You CAN and SHOULD exercise!** Regular activity actually improves asthma control.

### Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)

Many people with asthma have symptoms during/after exercise. This is manageable!

**Symptoms of EIB:**
- Coughing during/after exercise
- Wheezing
- Chest tightness
- Shortness of breath
- Symptoms usually peak 5-10 minutes after stopping

### Tips for Exercising Safely

**Before:**
- ✅ Use quick-relief inhaler 15-30 minutes before (if prescribed)
- ✅ Warm up 10-15 minutes
- ✅ Check air quality and pollen
- ✅ Avoid triggers (cold air, high pollen)

**During:**
- ✅ Breathe through your nose
- ✅ Build up gradually
- ✅ Take breaks as needed
- ✅ Stay hydrated
- ✅ Keep rescue inhaler nearby

**After:**
- ✅ Cool down slowly
- ✅ Watch for delayed symptoms

### Best Activities for Asthma
- 🏊 Swimming (warm, humid environment)
- 🚶 Walking
- 🚴 Cycling
- 🧘 Yoga
- ⚾ Sports with rest periods

### Activities That May Be Harder
- Long-distance running
- Cold-weather sports (skiing, ice skating)
- Activities without breaks

**Note:** Many Olympic athletes have asthma — it shouldn't stop you!

## Managing Flare-Ups

A flare-up (or attack) is when symptoms suddenly get worse.

### Early Warning Signs
Watch for these — they often appear 1-2 days before:
- Increased coughing
- Waking at night
- Needing rescue inhaler more
- Peak flow dropping
- Feeling tired
- Changes in mucus

### During a Flare-Up

1. **Stay calm** — anxiety makes breathing harder
2. **Stop what you're doing** — rest
3. **Use rescue inhaler** — 2-4 puffs
4. **Sit upright** — easier to breathe
5. **Practice pursed-lip breathing**
6. **Follow your action plan**
7. **Get help if not improving**

### When to Get Emergency Help

🚨 **Call 911 immediately if:**
- Can't speak in full sentences
- Lips or fingernails turning blue
- Rescue inhaler not helping after 15-20 minutes
- Can't walk due to breathlessness
- Confused or very drowsy
- Chest retractions (skin pulling between ribs)

---

## Asthma and Allergies

About 80% of people with asthma also have allergies.

### Managing Allergic Asthma

**Allergy Testing:**
- Skin prick test or blood test
- Identifies specific triggers
- Guides avoidance and treatment

**Allergy Treatments:**
- Antihistamines (Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra)
- Nasal corticosteroid sprays
- Allergy shots (immunotherapy)
- Avoiding allergens

**Tips:**
- Shower after being outdoors
- Keep windows closed during high pollen
- Use air conditioning
- Remove carpets if possible
- Control dust and mold

---

## Asthma in Special Situations

### Pregnancy
- Continue asthma medicines (well-controlled asthma is safer than uncontrolled)
- Most asthma medicines are safe during pregnancy
- Poor control poses risks to baby
- Work closely with your doctor

### Illness & Surgery
- Tell all doctors you have asthma
- Keep using controller medicines
- May need adjustments before surgery
- Treat respiratory infections early

### Travel
- Bring enough medicine for trip + extra
- Carry rescue inhaler in carry-on
- Know where to get help at destination
- Consider medical alert bracelet

---

## Working with Your Healthcare Team

### Regular Checkups
Even when feeling well, see your provider:
- Every 3-6 months if well controlled
- More often if having issues
- Annually review and update action plan

### Questions to Ask
- Is my asthma well controlled?
- Should we adjust my medicines?
- Am I using my inhaler correctly?
- Are there new treatment options?
- When should I call you?

### What to Bring to Appointments
- Your action plan
- Peak flow diary
- List of all medicines
- Questions written down
- Your inhalers (to check technique)
