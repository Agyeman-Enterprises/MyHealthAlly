Health concerns can vary in urgency. This guide helps you understand when immediate medical attention is needed versus when routine evaluation may be appropriate.

## Emergency Situations

Seek immediate emergency care (call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department) for:
- Chest pain or pressure
- Severe difficulty breathing
- Signs of stroke (sudden weakness, numbness, speech changes)
- Severe allergic reactions
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Loss of consciousness
- Severe trauma
- Suicidal thoughts or self-harm urges

## Urgent Care Situations

Consider urgent evaluation (same-day or next-day) for:
- Severe pain that's new or worsening
- High fever with concerning symptoms
- Significant injury
- Sudden changes in vision or mental status
- Severe dehydration signs

## Routine Evaluation

Routine evaluation may be appropriate for:
- Ongoing symptoms that are stable
- Preventive care needs
- Chronic condition management
- Non-urgent questions or concerns

## Red Flags to Watch For

Certain symptoms warrant prompt evaluation:
- Sudden onset of severe symptoms
