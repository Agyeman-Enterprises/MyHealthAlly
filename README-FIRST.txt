WHAT THIS IS
------------
This package fixes your JSX guard problem WITHOUT touching app code.

You will:
1) Drop these files into your repo root
2) Tell Cursor to wire them in
3) Re-run npm run verify

This prevents .map() in JSX from ever blocking production again.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE.
